# ActiveLearning_ARIEN

- Create the **conda environment** using the *arien_env.yml* file.
- Open the *Annotation.ipynb* file.

# Î¤ext Annotation.
- For **text annotation** use the *active_learning_text.py* file following the instructions. Define the path to your text data (.txt file) and the path to the labels (.txt file). You can train a new model or you can use the existing model to create annotations.
- In the *active_learning_text.py* file, you run the code for training and / or annotation, using the example files (*example_text_data_for_training.txt* and *example_text_labels_for_training.txt* to train a model, *example_text_data_for_annotation.txt* and *example_text_labels_for_annotation.txt* to use the pretrained model to make annotations).


# Image Annotation.
- For **image annotation** use the *active_learning_images.py* file following the instructions. Define the path to your image data (folder with images) and the path to the labels. You can train a new model or you can use the existing model to create annotations.
